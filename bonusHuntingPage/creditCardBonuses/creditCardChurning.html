                <p>America is filled with idiots. Millions of them. Widespread financial ignorance has created a culture where credit card companies dangle hundreds of dollars in sign-up bonuses to lure in new customers. For those who don’t understand basic credit and debt management—like the simple concept of paying back borrowed money—these offers turn into traps.</p>
                <p>Americans now have over a trillion dollars in credit card debt, and with an average interest rate of over 20%, credit card companies are raking in more than $200 billion a year just from interest payments. This is why they’re so eager to give out "free money"—they’re hoping to trap you into debt. Don’t be one of those suckers. Be the person who takes the banks' money instead of handing it over. Make their money YOUR money.</p>

        <h2>Introductory Offers Hacked: Churning Your Way to Free Money</h2>
        <p>Credit cards are notorious for offering tempting sign-up bonuses, like: “Spend $500 in the first 3 months and get $200 back.” While $200 is great, the real benefit is that many banks offer similar bonuses across multiple cards. This lets you take advantage of sign-up offers one after the other. Follow these steps to consistently earn rewards without extra spending:</p>
        <ol style="font-size: 1.2em;">
            <li>Apply for a card with a bonus offer, like “Spend $500 in 90 days, get $200.”</li>
            <li>Use the card for your regular expenses—things you would buy anyway—until you meet the $500 threshold. This means no extra spending; just use the card for your usual purchases.</li>
            <li>Collect your reward! Whether it’s cashback, points, or a statement credit, you’ve earned free money for doing what you already do.</li>
            <li>Stop using the card once you get the bonus. Lock the card in your app to avoid fraudulent charges, then store it away and don’t touch it again. You’ve already received your reward, so there’s no need to keep spending.</li>
            <li>Repeat with a new card and a new bonus offer. Move on to the next card, continuing the process of churning.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Always pay off the full balance before the due date for each card to avoid interest charges.</p>
        <p>This strategy—known as credit card churning—works well for individuals with low expenses, such as younger people. By following these steps, you can earn "free money," build your credit, and often reach the spending requirements using only your usual expenses. Just remember, don’t spend more than you normally would to reach the bonus. Avoid lifestyle inflation at all costs! Treat each card like a debit card, and you’ll be maximizing rewards without falling into debt.</p>

                <h2 class = "card-title">Warning: Always Pay Off Your Card</h2>
                <p>Credit cards are NOT free money. Every dollar you spend must be paid back. If you don’t pay your full balance by the due date, you’ll be charged interest—and credit card interest rates are sky-high.</p>
                <p><strong style="padding-bottom: 5px; background-color: yellow;">NEVER EVER EVER PAY INTEREST!</strong></p>
                <p>To avoid this, set up autopay immediately after getting your card. Link it to your bank account and choose to pay the full balance every month. If you spend more than you can afford, you’ll fall into the trap of paying interest, effectively giving your money to the bank instead of taking advantage of their rewards.</p>
                <p>Treat your credit card like a debit card: only spend what you’d already buy with cash. If you’re not good with money or are already in debt, using a credit card could make things worse. You’ll likely dig yourself deeper into debt.

        <h2>Which Cards To Start With: Explanations</h2>
        <h2>Beginners (No Credit Score At All)</h2>
        <p>If you’re young or don’t have a credit score yet, most credit card companies will see you as too risky to offer credit. However, Discover is one company that doesn’t care about your credit history. They’ll give anyone a credit card, making it a great option for beginners. Not only are they easy to get, but they also have straightforward rewards and the best customer service of any bank I’ve dealt with. You won’t get stuck on hold for hours with someone you can barely understand—they have friendly American representatives who pick up quickly.</p>
        <p>While the sign-up bonus isn’t huge with Discover, it’s a great starting point to build credit, so you’ll be eligible for better offers down the road.</p>
        <div class="cardSectionDivID">  
            <img src="Images/discoverItChrome.jpg" alt="Discover IT Chrome Card" id ="DiscoverItChromeImage" class = "card-image" >
            <div class="card-content"> 
                <h3 class = "card-title">Discover IT Chrome</h3>
                <p>I have a referral link for the Discover IT Chrome card, where we’ll both receive $100. You’ll get 2% cash back on restaurants and gas, and 1% on everything else. For the first year, those rewards are doubled, so you’ll earn 4% on gas and restaurants and 2% on everything else. Not bad for a starter card. Click the link below:</p>
                <p><a href="https://refer.discover.com/s/paulsjac000?advocate.partner_share_id=7305981829" target="_blank" >Discover IT Chrome</a></p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The Discover IT Cash Back card is another great option for beginners. You get 5% cash back on a category that change every 3 months (such as Amazon, restaurants, or gas stations), and 1% on everything else.</p>
        <p>After about 6 months with a Discover cards, you’ll have a credit score and can start applying for better offers.</p>
        <h2>Intermediate (Credit History of 1+ Years, At least One Credit Card)</h2>
        <p>If you’ve built up a credit history of over a year, whether from a credit card or another type of loan, you should qualify for the cards listed in this section. However, if you already have a decent credit history, I’d recommend skipping Discover cards. They’re great for beginners, but the lower sign-up bonuses and less impressive cash-back rates mean there are better options available.</p>
        <p>At this stage, I wouldn’t recommend any cards with an annual fee. There are plenty of no-annual-fee cards with solid sign-up bonuses, and you can consider fee-bearing cards once you’re more experienced with credit card churning.</p>
        <p>For now, I’d suggest focusing on Chase or Capital One. Both offer strong credit cards but make it harder to qualify for their products once you’ve already accumulated several cards. Chase, in particular, is known for its great rewards and easy-to-earn sign-up bonuses. Here are the cards I recommend starting with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/BT00LN946S?externalReferenceId=42d266ea-6edf-4de9-965d-b2310af4a856" target="_blank" >Chase Prime Visa</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.referyourchasecard.com/18N/6TC77OQ7ZM" target="_blank" >Chase Freedom Flex</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.referyourchasecard.com/18N/6TC77OQ7ZM" target="_blank" >Chase Freedom Unlimited</a></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="cardSectionDivID">
            <img src="Images/chaseAmazonPrime.jpg" alt="Chase Prime Visa Card" id="ChaseAmazonPrimeImage" class="card-image">
            <div class="card-content"> 
                <h3 class = "card-title">Chase Prime Visa</h3>
                <p>The Chase Prime Visa is probably my top recommendation in this tier. If you’re like millions of Americans who buy a lot of stuff on Amazon, this card is a game-changer. You’ll get a $200 Amazon gift card as soon as you’re approved, without even needing to make a purchase. Plus, you’ll earn 5% cash back on every Amazon purchase and 5% cash back at Whole Foods. This is a big win for anyone who shops at either place regularly, as it saves me hundreds annually. The card is made of metal, which is a nice touch and feels good to use. Also, it has no foreign transaction fees, so it’s perfect for international travel.</p>
                <p>You need to be an Amazon Prime member to apply, but if you are, you’re basically throwing away money by not having this card and paying 5% more on Amazon than you need to.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="cardSectionDivID">
            <img src="Images/chaseFreedomFlex.jpg" alt="Chase Freedom Flex Card" id = "ChaseFreedomFlexImage" class = "card-image">
            <div class="card-content"> 
                <h3 class = "card-title">Chase Freedom Flex</h3>
                <p>The Chase Freedom Flex is a fantastic option for earning rewards, especially if you want to make the most out of rotating categories. With a typical sign-up bonus of $200 for $500 in spend, it’s a great entry point into the world of credit card rewards. Plus, it comes with no annual fee, which makes it even more appealing.</p>
                <p>The real beauty of this card is the 5% cash back on categories that change every 3 months, like Amazon, gas stations, restaurants, and more. For example, in Q4 of 2024, the rotating category was PayPal, which worked out perfectly for me during holiday shopping. I was able to get 5% cash back on all my online purchases—Black Friday deals, Christmas gifts, and Cyber Monday sales, all of which helped me save money while still earning the $200 sign-up bonus. This is why I love the Freedom Flex; it’s so versatile and makes it easy to rack up cash back on everyday purchases, as well as larger seasonal spending.</p>
                <p>It’s not a card I’d use for everything, but it’s perfect for when the rotating categories offer something valuable like dining or groceries. I plan to keep using the Freedom Flex when those categories align with things I’m already buying, like eating out or stocking up on food. Outside of those times, I prefer other cards with higher cash back rates, but when the Freedom Flex hits those high-value categories, it’s the one I grab.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="cardSectionDivID">
            <img src="Images/chaseFreedomUnlimited.jpg" alt="Chase Freedom Unlimited Card" id="ChaseFreedomUnlimitedImage" class = "card-image">
            <div class="card-content">
                <h3 class = "card-title">Chase Freedom Unlimited</h3>
                <p>Chase Freedom Unlimited typically has a sign on bonus of around $250 for $500 of spend. The card gives you 3% cash back at restaurants and pharmacies. Then 1.5% cash back on all other purchases. I would sign up, spend $500, then get the sign on bonus and store this card away. It is just average besides the large sign on bonus. I have no reason to use mine.</p>
            </div>            
        </div>
        <div class="card-content">
            <h3 class = "card-title">American Express After Chase</h3>     
            <p>After you’ve acquired these Chase cards, I’d recommend moving on to American Express (AMEX). AMEX has some of the best credit cards on the market, and starting a relationship with them early can lead to future cards with very high sign-up bonuses. Here are two excellent options to consider:</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://americanexpress.com/en-us/referral/blue-cash-everyday-credit-card?ref=JACKPcCuq&XL=MIMNS" target="_blank" >American Express Blue Cash Everyday</a></li>

        </ul>
        <div class="cardSectionDivID">
            <img src="Images/AMEXBlueCashEveryday.jpg" alt="American Express Blue Cash Everyday Card" id="AMEXBCEImage" class = "card-image">
            <div class="card-content">
                <h3 class = "card-title">American Express Blue Cash Everyday</h3>
                <p>American Express has a certain coolness to it that you can't ignore. It's a brand that just feels a little more elevated, even if you're starting with a card like the Blue Cash Everyday. While it may not have the flashiest rewards or benefits, the card still makes you feel like you're making smart choices with your money. Plus, it’s designed to look sharp — it's got that sleek, recognizable AMEX feel, which is always a bonus when you're pulling it out at the store.</p>
                <p>I used this card for over two years while I was in college, and it helped me more than I expected. The 3% cash back on groceries, gas, and online purchases is a real game-changer, especially when you’re trying to keep costs down. The $200 sign-up bonus after meeting a $2,000 spend requirement in the first 6 months was a huge boost, and it’s a bonus that’s easy to hit just by making your regular purchases.</p>
                <p>What makes this card ideal for churning is the simplicity — it’s a great entry-level card with solid returns that’s easy to use and great for getting your foot in the AMEX door. The rewards program is straightforward, and it’s a no-brainer for anyone who’s starting out with credit card churning or looking for a low-maintenance card that gets the job done.</p>
                <p>Even though it’s an “entry-level” AMEX, it still has that cool factor and is a solid card for building credit and earning cash back on the things you spend on every day. It’s the kind of card that not only helps you out now, but sets you up for bigger rewards with AMEX in the future.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="cardSectionDivID">
            <img src="Images/AMEXHiltonHonors.jpg" alt="American Express Hilton Honors Card" id = "HiltonHonorsImage" class = "card-image">
            <div class="card-content">
                <h3 class = "card-title">American Express Hilton Honors</h3>
                <p>The American Express Hilton Honors card is an excellent choice for anyone planning a vacation, especially if you're staying at a Hilton property. With a generous sign-up bonus and solid ongoing rewards, it’s a smart way to make your trip more affordable. Whether you're planning a quick getaway or a long vacation, this card can help you earn free nights and extra perks during your stay.</p>
                <p>The card offers a 100,000 Hilton Honors points sign-up bonus after you spend $2,000 in the first 3 months. That’s equivalent to about $500 in hotel stays, as Hilton points are valued at roughly half a penny each. With these points, you could redeem three free nights at a mid-tier Hilton hotel. I would recommend staying at an embassy suite. Having a living room in your hotel makes it feel much more spacious.</p>
                <p>On top of the sign-up bonus, you’ll earn 7 points per dollar on Hilton hotel stays, which is like getting 3.5% cash back on your hotel spend. You’ll also earn 5 points per dollar on dining, groceries, and gas—equivalent to about 2.5% cash back. For all other purchases, you earn 3 points per dollar, which is about 1.5% back in cash. Plus, with Hilton Silver status, you’ll get extra perks like room upgrades and late check-out, helping make your trip even smoother.</p>
                <p>The rewards on spend are just okay. I would recommend getting the bonus and moving on. This card has a nice sign on bonus, but there are better cards out there.</p>
            </div>

        <h2>Advanced (Experienced with Credit Cards & Ready to Maximize Rewards)</h2>
        <div class="cardSectionDivID">
            <img src="Images/AMEXGold.jpg" alt="American Express Gold Card" id ="AMEXGoldImage" class = "card-image">
            <div class="card-content">
                <h3 class = "card-title">American Express Gold Card</h3>
                <p>The American Express Gold Card is a premium card with an impressive sign-on bonus and a hefty annual fee. When I signed up, I earned 90,000 American Express points after spending $6,000 in 6 months. With each point valued at 1 cent, the bonus is worth about $900. However, it’s important to factor in the card’s $325 annual fee, which can feel steep. But don’t let that discourage you, because the fee is offset by hundreds of dollars in credits each year.</p>
                <p>One of the key perks of the Gold Card is the $10 monthly credit for select restaurants, such as Five Guys and The Cheesecake Factory. For me, this works out perfectly—I either treat myself to a burger or get my wife a slice of cheesecake each month. The value of these credits depends on your location and dining preferences, but for me, it’s a nice bonus that helps balance out the cost of the card. If you’re curious about how the Gold Card can benefit you, try this useful calculator: <a href="https://www.asksebby.com/credit-card-reviews/amex-gold-card"  target="_blank"> Gold Card Calculator.</a></p>
                <p>Aside from the credits, the Gold Card offers 4X points on dining and groceries, which is a great way to rack up points if you eat out or shop for groceries regularly. This card really shines for couples or families who tend to dine out often. It's especially great for those who enjoy using dining credits like the ones offered each month.</p>
                <p>The card itself is also a statement piece—made from metal, it feels high-end and looks great when you pull it out. It’s definitely a fun card to carry, especially for those who appreciate having a premium product in their wallet.</p>
                <p>That said, the Gold Card can require a bit of effort to fully take advantage of its credits, and I wouldn’t recommend it for someone just starting out with credit cards. If you’re new to churning or if you’re looking for something simpler, you might want to start with a no-annual-fee card. But if you’re in a relationship, enjoy dining out, or have a family, the Gold Card can be a fantastic fit with its valuable credits and solid earning potential.</p>

        <h2>How Banks Shield Themselves from Excessive Card Churning</h2>

        <p>Banks are well aware that some people open credit cards just for the sign-up bonuses. To protect themselves from excessive card churning, banks have introduced several rules to limit how often you can apply for and receive new cards. If you're planning to churn cards for bonuses, it's important to know these rules so you can plan your strategy.</p>

        <div class="rulesSectionDiv">
            <img src = "Images/chaseLogo.png" alt = "Chase Logo" class = "logo-image">
            <div class="card-content"> 
                <h3 class = "card-title">Chase 5/24 Rule</h3>
                <p>The Chase 5/24 Rule is one of the strictest anti-churning rules. Chase will automatically decline your application if you’ve been approved for more than five credit cards (from any bank) in the past 24 months.</p>
                <p>Because of this rule, it’s smart to prioritize Chase cards if you want to maximize your sign-up bonuses. Start by applying for the Chase cards with the best rewards, like the <a href="https://www.referyourchasecard.com/18N/6TC77OQ7ZM" target="_blank">Chase Freedom Flex</a> or <a href="https://www.referyourchasecard.com/18N/6TC77OQ7ZM" target="_blank" >Chase Freedom Unlimited</a>, early in your churning journey before the 5/24 rule becomes a problem for you.</p>

            <div class="card-content"> 
                <h3 class = "card-title">Capital One’s Restrictions</h3>
                <p>Unlike Chase, Capital One doesn’t have a formal anti-churning rule, but they’re still very selective. They’re known for rejecting applicants who have recently opened multiple cards, even if your overall credit score is good.</p>
                <p>For example, I applied for a Capital One card with only one new credit card in the past two years and was declined. If you’ve opened multiple cards recently, your chances of approval with Capital One are slim.</p>
                <p>If you’re interested in a Capital One card, make sure it’s one of the first cards you apply for. If you already have two or more cards, you’re likely better off focusing on other banks, as getting approved by Capital One will be much harder. Personally, I’ve never been able to get a Capital One card and probably never will.</p>

                <h3 class="card-title">American Express Rules</h3>
                <p class="american-express-rules-paragraph">American Express has a strict policy that limits you to <strong class="bold-underline">one credit card approval every five days</strong>. If you’re planning to apply for multiple Amex cards, you’ll need to space out your applications accordingly.</p>
                <p class="american-express-rules-paragraph">Additionally, you’re limited to being approved for a maximum of <strong class="bold-underline">two credit cards within a rolling 90-day period</strong>. Charge cards, like the Amex Platinum or Gold, don’t count toward this limit, so you can still apply for those even if you’ve hit the 2/90 rule for credit cards.</p>
                <p class="american-express-rules-paragraph">American Express enforces a limit on the total number of credit cards you can hold at one time. As of now, most people are limited to <strong class="bold-underline">four or five Amex credit cards</strong>, depending on your profile and relationship with the bank. Charge cards do not count toward this limit.</p>
                <p>American Express has a <strong class="bold-underline">once-per-lifetime rule</strong> for their welcome bonuses. This means you can only receive the welcome bonus for each specific Amex card once, even if you close the card and reapply later. Be strategic about when you apply to maximize the value of your bonuses.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Credit Card Intro Bonuses</h2>

        <h3>How Will This Impact My Credit Score?</h3>

        <p>Your credit score is made up of different parts, as shown in the image below. Opening a new credit card or loan affects only a small part of your score.</p>

        <p>New credit makes up 10% of your score. This includes any accounts you've recently opened or any applications for credit that required a hard inquiry. A hard inquiry happens when a lender checks your credit to decide if they’ll approve you, and it can cause your score to drop a few points for a short time.</p>

        <p>When you open a new account, it also lowers the average age of your credit history, which makes up 15% of your score. These two parts together (new credit and credit history) can temporarily affect up to 25% of your score. On average, opening a new account drops your score by about 10 points, but this drop is temporary and usually goes away after a few months.</p>

        <p>Over time, opening new accounts can actually help your score by giving you more credit to use, which improves other parts of your score.</p>

        <p>If you’re planning to take out a big loan, like a mortgage or car loan, in the next year, it’s a good idea to avoid opening new accounts so your score stays as high as possible. But if you’re not planning on getting a loan soon, the small, temporary drop won’t cause any long-term problems.</p>

        <p>For a more in depth explanation please read this article: <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/credit-cards/advice/how-credit-inquiries-affect-credit-score/#dispute"  target="_blank">How Credit Inquires Affect Your Credit Score</a></p>

        </div>

        <h3>Is This Legal?</h3>
        <p>Yes, credit card churning is completely legal. As long as you follow the terms and conditions outlined by the card issuer when you sign up, you're fully within the rules. Just do not cancel a card until at earliest a year after opening. This may violate the term and conditions.</p>

        <h3>Is This Ethical?</h3>
        <p>Let’s be real—banks are some of the most unethical companies out there. If you feel bad for them, you are a big-time cuck. These corporations make billions by charging ridiculously high interest rates to people who are already struggling financially.</p>
        <p>On top of that, many big banks regularly get caught doing shady, unethical things. For example, Wells Fargo was fined for opening millions of unauthorized accounts under customers’ names just to charge them extra fees.</p>
        <p>So, is it unethical to churn cards and take advantage of sign-up bonuses? Absolutely not. In fact, it’s the ethical thing to do. By legally earning rewards from these banks, we’re putting money back into the hands of everyday people like you and me. Consider it a small form of justice in an unfair system.</p>

        <h3>How Do You Fit All These Cards in Your Wallet?</h3>
        <p>I don’t. Instead, I add most of my cards to Apple Pay and use that for most purchases. I typically keep only 3 cards in my wallet at a time:</p>
        <ul style="font-size: 1.2em;">
            <li>American Express Gold Card: For groceries and dining out, which earn the best cash back or rewards.</li>
            <li>Robinhood Gold Card: For all other purchases, offering a simple 3% cash back on everything.</li>
            <li>Current Bonus Card: When I’m working toward a sign-up bonus, I’ll keep that card in my wallet until I hit the spending requirement. Afterward, I retire it and return to using the two main cards or move on to the next bonus.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This setup keeps things simple while still maximizing rewards, and using Apple Pay makes it easy to access any card when I need it.</p>
        <h3>Is It Hard to Manage Multiple Credit Cards?</h3>

        <p>Not at all! I use an app called Max Rewards that does all the tracking for me. It syncs all my cards from different issuers, keeping track of balances and due dates, so I always know when to pay. The app also recommends the best card to use for each purchase, helping me maximize cash back and rewards. Link to app here: <a href="https://maxrewards.app.link/JackPaulson"  target="_blank">Max Rewards</a></p>
        <p>To ensure I never miss a payment, I’ve set up autopay on all of my cards. This way, I don’t have to worry about missing a payment, which could hurt my credit score.</p>

        <h2>Important Notes on How Using Cards and Credit Impacts Spending</h2>
        <p>Studies show that people tend to spend more money when using credit cards compared to cash. Why? Swiping or tapping a card feels far less "real" than handing over physical cash—it’s simply less mentally painful.</p>
        <p>Don’t fall into the trap of overspending just because it’s easy. Stick to your regular budget and use your credit card only for purchases you were already planning to make. Avoid lifestyle inflation at all costs! Just because you have access to credit doesn’t mean you should start buying things you don’t need. Discipline is key to making credit work for you, not against you.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Don't Use Cards With Annual Fees</h2>
        <p>If you’re new to credit cards, it’s best to avoid cards with annual fees. These fees are charged every year just for keeping the card, and they can quickly eat into any rewards you earn. Luckily, there are plenty of excellent no-annual-fee cards that offer great rewards and perks, so there’s no need to jump into fee-based cards right away.</p>
        <p>While some cards with annual fees do have attractive sign-up bonuses, you’re better off focusing on no-fee cards first. You can always look into annual fee cards later, once you’ve built a solid credit history and maximized the free offers. Plus, sticking to no-fee cards means you won’t have to worry about canceling the card in the future or justifying the yearly cost.</p>

        <h2>Other Card Recommendations</h2>
        <p>While I don’t have referral links for these, the following cards are ones I personally use regularly and provide great value or fantastic cash back:</p>

        <div class="cardSectionDivID">
            <img src="Images/AAAGasHorizontal.jpg" alt="AAA Travel Card" id="AAATravelImage" class = "card-image">
            <div class="card-content">
                <h3 class = "card-title">AAA Travel Card</h3>
                <p>I keep this card in my car and use it exclusively for gas. It earns 5% cash back on gas purchases, which adds up quickly. When I signed up, I received a small bonus of $100 after spending $1,000. The best part? You don’t need to be an AAA member to get this card, making it accessible for anyone looking to save on gas.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="cardSectionDivID">
            <img src="Images/citiCustomCash.jpg" alt="Citi Custom Cash Card" id="CitiCustomCashImage" class="card-image">
            <div class="card-content">
                <h3 class = "card-title">Citi Custom Cash</h3>
                <p>This card offers 5% cash back on your highest spend category each billing cycle, making it perfect for maximizing rewards on a specific purchase category. I recommend picking one category (like groceries) and using it only for that. For example, if groceries are your biggest monthly expense, this card will earn you 5% back on all grocery purchases. I received a $200 sign-up bonus after spending $1,500 in the first 3 months, which was a nice bonus to add on top of the cash back. It’s a straightforward, flexible card that rewards you for what you spend the most on.</p>

        <div class="cardSectionDivID">
            <img src="Images/AMEXHiltonSurpass.jpg" alt="American Express Hilton Surpass Card" id = "AMEXHiltonSurpassImage" class = "card-image">
            <div class="card-content">
                <h3>American Express Hilton Surpass</h3>
                <p>The American Express Hilton Surpass card is a great fit for me because I travel frequently for work and always stay at Hilton properties. While the card comes with a $150 annual fee, I find that I get far more value out of it.</p>
                <p>Each quarter, you receive $50 in Hilton credit, which can be used to purchase Hilton gift cards from this website: <a href="https://www.buyhiltongiftcards.com/" target="_blank">Hilton Gift Cards</a>. These can be spent at the hotel spa, restaurant, or even to pay for your room—basically, $200 in Hilton credit each year. This alone more than offsets the annual fee.</p>
                <p>Additionally, Hilton Gold status is automatically granted with the card. This status increases your chances of getting room upgrades and gives you an 80% boost in Hilton points earned per stay. With the amount I travel, those extra points quickly add up, further justifying the card’s fee. Plus, there's a nice perk of free bottled water at Hilton properties, which I always grab during check-ins.</p>
                <p>The sign-up bonus is also impressive. Right now, you can earn 165,000 Hilton Honors Points after spending $3,000 in the first 6 months. With Hilton Honors points valued at about half a penny each, that’s a $825 value. For reference, a mid-tier Hilton hotel requires about 30,000 points per night, so the sign-on bonus could easily cover 5 hotel nights for your next vacation—quite a deal for just a $150 annual fee.</p>
                <p>The card offers excellent earnings as well:</p>
                <ul style="font-size: 1.2em;">
                    <li>12X points (6%) on Hilton purchases</li>
                    <li>6X points (3%) on dining, groceries, and gas—three of the biggest spend categories</li>
                    <li>3X points (1.5%) on all other purchases</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you value Hilton points and travel often, this card offers a very strong return on spend. For someone like me who frequently stays at Hiltons for business, it’s an essential card. However, if you don’t travel often or don’t have any vacations planned, this card might not be as useful for you.</p>

        <div class="cardSectionDivID">
            <img src="Images/RobinhoodGoldCard.jpg" alt="Robinhood Gold Card" id = "RobinhoodGoldCardImage" class = "card-image">
            <div class="card-content">
                <h3 class = "card-title">Robinhood Gold Card</h3>
                <p>The Robinhood Gold Card offers a straightforward 3% cash back on every purchase, making it a reliable choice for earning rewards on all your spending. The app is user-friendly, which makes tracking purchases and rewards easy. Unfortunately, there’s no sign-up bonus with this card.</p>
                <p>I use this card for purchases where I don’t earn a higher cash-back rate with my other cards, and it has become my go-to for everyday spending. The catch is that you need to be a Robinhood Gold member to access this card. As someone who’s been a Robinhood user since I was 18, and already a Gold member, the card was a natural choice for me.</p>
                <p>One of the main advantages of this card is its simplicity. If I ever decide to stop juggling multiple cards or want to simplify my spending, this could easily become my primary card for all purchases. The flat 3% cash back on everything makes it easy to earn rewards without having to keep track of rotating categories or restrictions.</p>
                <p>If you're already a Robinhood Gold member, this card should be at the top of your list—it’s a great way to earn cash back on every purchase without worrying about complicated rules.</p>
